# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

This is a private, internal project for High Performance Technologies. Security vulnerabilities should be reported through internal channels only.

### Internal Reporting Process

If you discover a security vulnerability in VizVault:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Report the vulnerability directly to the project maintainer via internal communication channels
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested remediation (if available)

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours (business days)
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 48 hours
- **Remediation Plan**: Within 5 business days
- **Fix Implementation**: Based on severity (Critical: 24-48 hours, High: 3-5 days, Medium/Low: Next sprint)

## Security Measures

### Code Security

- All code undergoes automated security scanning via:
  - `govulncheck` - Go vulnerability database checks
  - `gosec` - Static application security testing
  - `gitleaks` - Secret detection
  - `trivy` - Container vulnerability scanning

### Pre-commit Hooks

Security checks are enforced before code commits:
- Secret detection via gitleaks
- Security scanning via gosec
- Vulnerability checking via govulncheck

### CI/CD Security

All pull requests and merges are automatically scanned for:
- Known vulnerabilities in dependencies
- Security issues in code
- Exposed secrets or credentials
- Container image vulnerabilities

### Dependency Management

- Dependencies are automatically monitored and updated via Dependabot
- Security updates are prioritized and applied weekly
- All dependencies undergo vulnerability scanning

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or secure vaults
2. **Keep dependencies updated**: Review and merge Dependabot PRs promptly
3. **Run security checks locally**: Use `make security` before pushing
4. **Follow secure coding practices**: Input validation, proper error handling, least privilege

### Production Security

- Production containers use distroless base images
- Minimal attack surface with non-root user execution
- No shell or package managers in production images
- Regular security audits and vulnerability assessments

## Compliance

As an internal project, VizVault adheres to High Performance Technologies' security policies and standards.
